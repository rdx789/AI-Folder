"""
NovaOps MCP server — policies + knowledge base + HR documents + database.

This is Lesson 9's server (itself Lesson 8's), grown by four read tools so the
onboarding workflow this lesson runs on has everything it needs:

  files    list_policies · get_policy
  FAISS    search_knowledge_base · search_hr_documents          <- hr_docs is new
  SQLite   get_employee · check_software_subscription
           list_onboarding_tasks · check_asset_inventory
           list_employee_tickets                                <- three new reads
  SQLite   create_access_request                                <- the only WRITE

Ten tools. That number is deliberate: every tool's name, description, and JSON
schema is sent to the model on every call that has tools bound, so ten schemas is
a standing input-token bill you pay whether or not the turn needs a single one of
them. Stage 03's tool loadout is about not paying it.

Run:
  python server.py        # serves at http://127.0.0.1:9877/mcp
