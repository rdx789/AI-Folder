"""
The database tools' engine (server side).

A tiny SQLite layer over the NovaOps seed data. The MCP server calls these plain
functions; the agent never touches SQL. Six tools live here:
  - get_employee()                 read  — look up people
  - check_software_subscription()  read  — seat usage for a SaaS (the over-limit signal)
  - list_onboarding_tasks()        read  — an employee's onboarding checklist
  - check_asset_inventory()        read  — laptops/monitors on hand
  - list_employee_tickets()        read  — that person's IT tickets
  - create_access_request()        WRITE — file a request, status pending_approval

The last one is the only tool that changes anything, which is why this lesson only
exposes it at the workflow stage where it belongs.

Lesson 9 shipped the first two reads and the write; the three middle reads are new
here. They exist so the tool catalogue is big enough for tool *selection* to matter:
ten schemas on every call is a real, measurable cost.

The DB is built in memory from data/database/{schema,seed}.sql on first use, so
there's no database file to create or clean up. Writes therefore live only for the
life of the server process and reset on restart — fine for a demo, not a real store.
