"""
NovaOps MCP server — policies + knowledge base + database (Exercise 3).

Exercise 1's server exposed two filesystem tools. This one keeps those and adds
four more, each backed by a completely different system:
  - search_knowledge_base()       -> vector search over the IT KB (rag.py)
  - get_employee()                -> a SQL lookup in the NovaOps database (db.py)
  - check_software_subscription() -> a SQL read: SaaS seat usage (db.py)
  - create_access_request()       -> a SQL WRITE: file an access request (db.py)

Six tools, three backends (plain files, a FAISS index, SQLite) — and to the agent
they are all just tools with a name and a schema. That uniformity is the whole
point of MCP. Notice that agent.py and client.py are UNCHANGED from Exercise 2:
only the server grew.

The last two tools set up Lesson 9: check_software_subscription surfaces the
"Webex is over its seat limit" signal, and create_access_request files the request
a human then approves — the approval gate Lesson 9's frameworks orchestrate.

Run:
  python server.py        # serves at http://127.0.0.1:9876/mcp
