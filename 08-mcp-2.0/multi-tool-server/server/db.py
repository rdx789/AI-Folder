"""
The database tool's engine (Exercise 3, server side).

A tiny SQLite layer over the NovaOps seed data. The MCP server calls these plain
functions; the agent never touches SQL. Three tools live here:
  - get_employee()                 read  — look up people
  - check_software_subscription()  read  — seat usage for a SaaS (the over-limit signal)
  - create_access_request()        WRITE — file a request, status pending_approval

The last one is the lab's first write tool. It's what Lesson 9 orchestrates: an
access request that a human then has to approve.

The DB is built in memory from data/database/{schema,seed}.sql on first use, so
there's no database file to create or clean up. Writes therefore live only for the
life of the server process and reset on restart — fine for a demo, not a real store.
